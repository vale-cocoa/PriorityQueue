# PriorityQueue

A queue data structure — with value semantics— whose elements are dequeued by priority order, which is associated to the value of the elements themself.
That is, given its associated type `Element` has to conform to `Comparable`, then stored elements are dequeued starting from the largest and ending to to the smallest.
